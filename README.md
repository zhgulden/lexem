***An interpreter*** is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. 

An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

<li> Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
<li> Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;
<li> Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.
